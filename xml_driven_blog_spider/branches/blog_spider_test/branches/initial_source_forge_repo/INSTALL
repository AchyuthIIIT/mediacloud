These are very brief, likely incomplete, installation instructions.  If you
want to install the system, follow these instructions as they are and
send any questions to info@mediacloud.org.

These instructions assume comfort with postgresql and especially with perl. You
will have a difficult time installing the system if you do not have experience
with perl and cpan.

* Install perl.

* Install postgresql (8.3 or greater).  Make sure that plperl support
  is included in your postgresql installation, or install the necessary
  addon packages for it.

* Create a postgres database and user.  The database user must be a superuser
  to run some of the plperl procedural scripts. 
  (sudo su -; su - postgres; createuser -s mediaclouduser; 
  createdb --owner mediaclouduser mediacloud)

* Run script/mediawords.sql under the new database and user to create the
  mediacloud database. 
  (psql -U mediaclouduser mediacloud < script/mediawords.sql)
  
* Copy mediawords.yml.dist to mediawords.yml and edit to suit your local
  configuration.  
  
* If you want to use calais tagging, you'll need to apply for a calais key 
  and enter the key into mediawords.yml.  Then change 'NYTTopics' for the
  default_tag_modules setting to 'NYTTopics Calais',
  
* Copy lib/MediaWords/DB.pm.dist to lib/MediaWords/DB.pm and edit to suit
  your local database details.
  
* As root, run 'PERL5LIB=<mediacloud dir>/lib cpan Bundle::MediaWords' to
  install the many, many perl module dependencies.  Expect this to take a
  long time and install scores of module.  I suggest running 
  'o conf prerequisites_policy follow' from within the cpan shell, eg:
  
  ****
  # PERL5LIB=/home/hroberts/mediawords/lib cpan
  cpan# o conf prerequisites_policy follow
  cpan# install Bundle::MediaWords
  ...
  ****
  
  Even with the prerequisites_policy set to follow, there are several modules
  that have interactive dependencies, so you'll have occasionally to check
  the installation process and respond to any questions that come up.
  
* Run script/mediawords_server.pl.  This should start up the web server.
  If the command line returns no errors, go to http://localhost:3000 
  (or replace localhost with whatever host the system is on) to
  access the server.
  
* Walk through the instructions in README.tutorial to setup a source
  in the web app; download, extract, and tag its stories; and browse
  the results.

* Perform brilliant analysis, fix our broken code, document how the system
  works, and otherwise contribute to the project.
